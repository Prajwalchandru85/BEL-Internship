# Employee Registration System with AI-Powered Verification

A modern employee registration system that combines facial recognition, real-time liveness detection, and secure data storage. The system uses advanced AI models to ensure secure and authentic user registration.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. Employee Information Management
- Secure employee data collection
- Password protection
- Security question/answer system for account recovery
- JSON-based secure storage system


### 2. AI-Powered Verification System

#### Face Detection and Recognition

The system implements a two-step verification process:
1. **Blink Detection**
   - Requires 3 natural blinks
   - Uses MediaPipe's face mesh for precise eye tracking
   - Real-time eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation

2. **Nod detection**
   - Requires 2 natural head nods
   - Tracks 468 facial landmarks in real-time
   - Prevents photo and video spoofing attempts

## ü§ñ AI Models Used

### 1. MediaPipe Face Mesh
- **Purpose**: Real-time facial landmark detection
- **Features**: 
  - Tracks 468 facial landmarks
  - 3D face mesh construction
